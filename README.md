# Fluid-Simulation Animation -From-Scratch-.
Numerical fluid simulation from scratch by solving Navier-Stokes without using fluid simulation specialized external libraries.

I hope is will be a clear introduction for mathematician (maybe even others and to me) to make fluid animations from sratch.

## Status.
Under construction.

## Sections.
+ Helmholtz decomposition

## Methadology.
To be written later.

## Helmholtz decomposition and periodic Poisson equation.


## Advection.
